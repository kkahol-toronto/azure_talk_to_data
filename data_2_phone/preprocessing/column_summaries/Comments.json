    "Comments": "### Column Summary: Comments\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Purpose\n\nThe **Comments** column is used to capture additional context, notes, or status updates regarding the technical migration, modernization, or decommissioning activities for an application or its infrastructure components. It includes progress updates, blockers, confirmations, technical details, and next steps, often referencing timelines, dependencies, or stakeholder communications.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Unique Values\n\n- **Total Unique Values:** 120+\n- **Examples:**\n  - \"There is no STRUTS framework as part of the application architecture at present. The same was eliminated and the corresponding modules were rewritten in Java Springboot.\"\n  - \"App fully Decommissioned\"\n  - \"GCP Migration is completed for Database. DB VMs decommissioning planned by Q2 2025 due to HRIMS dependency.\"\n  - \"Already done, as part of PCF migration\"\n  - \"TBD, due to Business priorities\"\n  - \"App migration completed on 14 Feb, yet to decommission\"\n  - \"6 VMs are pending, Followed with PDO. Internal dependencies.\"\n  - \"Modernized Struts to Java Angular and Springboot\"\n  - ...and many more.\n- **Nature of Values:** Free-text, frequently updated, may include specific dates, individual names, ticket numbers, and reasons for project status.\n\n---\n\n#### 3.

Observations\n\n- **Content Types:** Status updates (completed, pending, in progress), technical details (technology stack, migration type), blockers (e.g., dependencies, business priorities), confirmations, and exceptions.\n- **Usage:** Highly unstructured, can include critical information for project tracking, risk management, and stakeholder communication.\n- **Redundancy:** Some comments are repeated for multiple entries, indicating common statuses or outcomes.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.
