    "LL5+": "**Column Summary: LL5+**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe LL5+ column likely represents a user ID, employee code, or similar unique identifier for individuals at a specific organizational level (possibly \"Level 5+\" in a company or project). Each value corresponds to a specific person or entity, used for tracking, assignment, or responsibility purposes.\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are 99 unique values in this column.  \nExamples include: 'DCLEME13', 'CBOHN', 'JJACK348', 'SLINDSTR', etc.\n\n**Histogram:**  \nThe histogram below shows the distribution (frequency) of each unique value in the column (showing top counts for brevity):\n\n| Value       | Count |\n|-------------|-------|\n| RCORDEI1    | 182   |\n| DWIERZBI    | 123   |\n| GDIAZ1      | 90    |\n| RRAJESH8    | 87    |\n| AKANSKI     | 77    |\n| LSRINIVA    | 70    |\n| VDONTHY     | 70    |\n| JEISIMIN    | 70    |\n| UVIJAYAL    | 67    |\n| TBROWN99    | 64    |\n| ...         | ...   |\n\n- The most frequent value is RCORDEI1 (182 times).\n- Many values occur only a few times.\n\n**Distribution Visualization:**  \n- The column is highly skewed: a few values appear very often, while many others are rare.\n- This suggests that a small group of individuals/entities are responsible for a large portion of the entries.\n\n**Summary Table:**  \n- **Purpose:** Identifier for individuals/entities at Level 5+.\n- **Unique Values:** 99 (examples: DCLEME13, CBOHN, JJACK348, etc.).\n- **Histogram:** Highly skewed, with a few frequent values and many infrequent ones.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of all counts or a plot for visualization!"
