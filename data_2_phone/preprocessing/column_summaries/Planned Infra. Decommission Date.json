    "Planned Infra. Decommission Date": "**Column Summary: Planned Infra. Decommission Date**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThis column tracks the planned decommissioning dates for infrastructure assets. It is used for project management, forecasting, maintenance planning, and lifecycle management, enabling teams to schedule replacements, upgrades, or removals of infrastructure components in a timely and organized manner.\n\n---\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThe column contains 88 unique values, each representing a specific date (or time) when a piece of infrastructure is planned to be decommissioned. The values are primarily `datetime.datetime` objects ranging from 1900 to 2028, with one instance of a `datetime.time` object (00:00), which may indicate a missing or placeholder date.\n\n---\n\n**Histogram (Top Values):**\n\n| Decommission Date         | Count |\n|--------------------------|-------|\n| 2026-03-15               | 332   |\n| 2027-03-15               | 288   |\n| 2026-06-13               | 182   |\n| 2024-12-15               | 127   |\n| 2025-12-14               | 118   |\n| 2025-09-13               | 118   |\n| 2025-06-13               | 113   |\n| 2026-09-13               | 80    |\n| 2027-12-14               | 79    |\n| 2027-12-15               | 63    |\n| ... (78 more values)     | ...   |\n\n- The majority of entries cluster around a few key dates, suggesting these are common decommissioning cycles or planned project milestones.\n- There are a few outlier dates (e.g., 1900-03-30) and a time-only value (00:00), which may indicate data entry errors or placeholders.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Most Frequent Decommission Dates:**\n\n| Date          | Frequency |\n|---------------|-----------|\n| 2026-03-15    | 332       |\n| 2027-03-15    | 288       |\n| 2026-06-13    | 182       |\n| 2024-12-15    | 127       |\n| 2025-12-14    | 118       |\n| ...           | ...       |\n\n---\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Schedules future infrastructure removal or replacement.\n- **Unique Values:** 88 unique planned dates/times.\n- **Distribution:** Highly skewed; most assets are scheduled for decommission on a handful of dates, with a long tail of less common and possibly erroneous entries.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nReview entries with unusual dates (e.g., 1900-03-30, time-only 00:00) for data quality. Consider normalizing or flagging these for further investigation."
