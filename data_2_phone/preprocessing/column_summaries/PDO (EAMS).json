    "PDO (EAMS)": "Column Summary for: PDO (EAMS)\n\nPurpose:  \nThe PDO (EAMS) column categorizes each record by its associated Product Delivery Organization (PDO) or area within the EAMS (Enterprise Application Management System). This classification helps in grouping and analyzing data based on the responsible business unit, IT function, or project area.\n\nUnique Values:  \nThere are 36 unique values, including named departments (e.g., Industrial System IT, Ford Credit (FMCC)), numerical codes (e.g., 211, 222), and placeholders such as '-'. Some values represent business areas while others seem to be internal codes.\n\nUnique Values List:\n['Industrial System IT', 'Ford Credit (FMCC)', '-', 'Staffs IT', 'EPEO', 'Integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (I-ERP)', 'Marketing, Sales and Service', 333, 'ITO', 'FCSD Tech', 233, 211, 'Global Data Insight and Analytics (GDIA)', 232, 'Technology & Enterprise Services (TES)', 221, 222, 322, 311, 212, 111, 11, 323, 112, 223, 'Ford Pro', 321, 331, 'Enterprise Connectivity - PDO', 122, 332, 121, 'Not in EAMS', 231, 123, 12, 213]\n\nHistogram (Top 10 by count):\n| Value                                           | Count |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| -                                               | 782   |\n| Industrial System IT                            | 726   |\n| Marketing, Sales and Service                    | 482   |\n| Ford Credit (FMCC)                              | 428   |\n| FCSD Tech                                       | 279   |\n| Integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (I-ERP) | 264   |\n| EPEO                                            | 171   |\n| Staffs IT                                       | 132   |\n| ITO                                             | 69    |\n| Technology & Enterprise Services (TES)          | 50    |\n| Global Data Insight and Analytics (GDIA)        | 50    |\n\n(See full histogram for all counts.)\n\nHistogram (Full):\n{'-': 782, 'Industrial System IT': 726, 'Marketing, Sales and Service': 482, 'Ford Credit (FMCC)': 428, 'FCSD Tech': 279, 'Integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (I-ERP)': 264, 'EPEO': 171, 'Staffs IT': 132, 'ITO': 69, 'Technology & Enterprise Services (TES)': 50, 'Global Data Insight and Analytics (GDIA)': 50, 211: 46, 'Ford Pro': 35, 311: 31, 111: 25, 322: 20, 222: 17, 221: 16, 212: 13, 233: 10, 332: 8, 321: 8, 'Enterprise Connectivity - PDO': 7, 223: 7, 333: 5, 'Not in EAMS': 5, 122: 5, 121: 4, 232: 4, 112: 3, 323: 3, 231: 3, 331: 2, 11: 2, 213: 2, 123: 1, 12: 1}\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- The column is used for classifying records by business or IT areas.\n- The most common value is '-', possibly indicating missing or uncategorized records.\n- There is a mix of descriptive names and numerical codes, suggesting overlapping classification schemes or legacy coding.\n- The top 5 values account for the majority of records.\n- Some values (like 'Not in EAMS') indicate records not assigned to any recognized PDO."
