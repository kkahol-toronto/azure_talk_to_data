    "Architect": "**Summary of the 'Architect' Column**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe 'Architect' column identifies the lead architect responsible for a given project, task, or entry within the dataset. It is used to track accountability, workload distribution, and contributions by individual architects.\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are 99 unique architect identifiers in this column. Each value is a unique username or code representing a specific architect (e.g., 'RPRASA22', 'JLUCAS1', 'NMORALE7', etc.).\n\n**Histogram (Most Frequent Architects):**\n- NMORALE7: 249\n- JLUCAS1: 236\n- LWU14: 190\n- CKEMPSKI: 176\n- MMEHTA5: 152\n- GRAO3: 138\n- JHARPER2: 120\n- MBALAN2: 115\n- AELANGO: 102\n- RPRASA22: 97\n\n(Many others have lower frequencies, with a long tail of architects handling fewer projects.)\n\n**Key Points:**\n- The column is used for identifying and analyzing architect activity.\n- A small set of architects account for a large portion of the entries, while many others have relatively few assignments.\n- This can help in resource allocation, performance review, and workload balancing across the team."
