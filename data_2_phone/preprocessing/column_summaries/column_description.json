    "LL4+": "Summary of Column: LL4+\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe LL4+ column appears to represent user or staff identifiers, likely indicating which individual (such as an employee, analyst, or system user) is associated with a specific record or action in the dataset. This column is typically used to track responsibility, ownership, or activity attribution within an organization.\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are 90 unique values in the column, each representing a distinct user or group. Examples include:  \nSKING68, JPITTERL, JMALETZ, OTHERS, JKOONS, MNOWICK1, TSWEEN16, SRUNSON, VVIJAY55, SARAUJO3, and others.\n\n**Histogram (Top 10 most frequent values):**\n| Value      | Count |\n|------------|-------|\n| DBRIGHEN   | 277   |\n| FHIRSH     | 264   |\n| JKOONS     | 187   |\n| SFRANCI8   | 184   |\n| SKING68    | 172   |\n| TSWEEN16   | 145   |\n| IPANKAJ    | 143   |\n| RKENNEL    | 140   |\n| DNANDAN    | 127   |\n| VVIJAY55   | 125   |\n\n**Distribution Notes:**  \n- The frequency distribution is highly skewed: a few users (e.g., DBRIGHEN, FHIRSH, JKOONS) account for a large share of entries, while many users have very few records (over 30 users have \u22645 entries).\n- There is a special value OTHERS (102), possibly indicating records not attributable to a specific user.\n\n**In summary:**  \nLL4+ is a user identifier column with 90 unique values. Usage is concentrated among a few users, suggesting specialized roles or uneven workload/activity distribution.
