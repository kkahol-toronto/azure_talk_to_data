    "Job Count / Report Count / VM Count": "**Summary of Column: Job Count / Report Count / VM Count**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThis column represents a count\u2014either the number of jobs, reports, or virtual machines (VMs) associated with a particular record, depending on the dataset context. It quantifies how many items of the specified type are linked to each entry, which is useful for understanding workload distribution, resource allocation, or reporting frequency.\n\n---\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are a wide range of unique values, mostly integers (from 0 up to several thousand), along with a blank value (' '). The values include very small numbers (0, 1, 2, etc.), moderate numbers (10\u2013100), and some very large outliers (e.g., 1589, 4523, 6221). The blank value likely represents missing or undefined data.\n\n---\n\n**Histogram (Top Values):**\n\n| Value | Count |\n|-------|-------|\n| 4     | 250   |\n| 3     | 122   |\n| 2     | 102   |\n| 1     | 92    |\n| 6     | 82    |\n| 8     | 79    |\n| 5     | 70    |\n| 7     | 44    |\n| 9     | 38    |\n| 12    | 30    |\n| ...   | ...   |\n| Large values (e.g. 1589, 6221) | 1 each |\n| Blank (' ') | 6 |\n\nMost records have low counts (1\u201310), with a strong peak at 4 (250 occurrences). The frequency drops sharply as the numbers increase. High values (hundreds to thousands) are rare outliers.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- The column mainly captures small count values, with a few exceptionally high outliers.\n- Data is right-skewed, indicating most records have a low job/report/VM count.\n- The presence of blanks suggests some data quality or completeness issues.\n- This column is essential for workload, resource, or activity aggregation and analysis."
