    "APP NAME": "**Summary of Column: APP NAME**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe APP NAME column identifies the name of each application or system referenced in the dataset. It serves as a key descriptor, allowing users to distinguish between different software tools, platforms, or systems used within the organization.\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are a large number of unique application names (examples include 'Zebra Android Scanner', 'X-Functional Tire Estimator', 'XUI-Cross Network Messaging User Interface', 'GOaLS - Global Ordering and Logistics System', 'FCSD Remanufacturing System', etc.). These names represent a diverse set of applications, each with a distinct function within the business.\n\n**Histogram (Top Values by Frequency):**  \nBelow are some of the most frequently occurring application names and their counts, as provided:\n\n| Application Name                                        | Count |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| FCSD Remanufacturing System                             | 7     |\n| MyFordVehicles                                          | 7     |\n| GOaLS - Global Ordering and Logistics System            | 7     |\n| M&S Executive Dashboard                                 | 7     |\n| Sell-out reporting                                      | 6     |\n| SOF Releases                                            | 6     |\n| Global OnLine Dealer Database                           | 6     |\n| SMARTS/MOCA - Sales Mgmnt Analysis & Rptg Tool          | 6     |\n| VMACS - Vehicle Monitoring and Control System           | 6     |\n| Supplier Improvement Metrics                            | 6     |\n| ... (many more with 5, 4, etc.)                        |       |\n\n**Purpose of the Histogram:**  \nThe histogram shows how often each application name appears in the dataset. Most application names are unique or appear only a few times, but a handful are referenced more frequently (up to 7 times in this sample), indicating either their widespread use or multiple records related to them.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- **Purpose:** Identifies software/applications referenced in each record.\n- **Count of unique values:** Large (dozens or more).\n- **Most common values:** FCSD Remanufacturing System, MyFordVehicles, GOaLS - Global Ordering and Logistics System, etc. (each appearing 7 times).\n- **Distribution:** Most values appear only a few times; a small number are more prominent.\n\nIf you need a visualization or a more detailed breakdown (such as a chart or a full list), please let me know!"
