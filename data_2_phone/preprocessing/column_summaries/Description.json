    "Description": "Summary of the \"Description\" Column\n\nPurpose:\nThe Description column provides detailed information about each application, tool, or system in the dataset. It explains the function, business context, features, target users, and sometimes the technical architecture or history of the application. This column is essential for understanding what each entry in the dataset does, how it fits into the broader organization, and its value to the business.\n\nUnique Values:\n- The column contains a high number of unique, detailed text entries, each describing a different application or system.\n- There is some repetition, as evidenced by the histogram, where certain descriptions occur multiple times, indicating multiple records share the same or similar descriptions.\n\nHistogram (Top Occurrences):\n\nBelow is a summary of the most frequently occurring description values and their counts:\n\nDescription (truncated/first 100 chars) | Count\n-----------------------------------------|------\nThe FST Application supports implementation of critical accounting and financial processes, and the trac... | 9\nThe M&S Executive Dashboard is a reporting tool and data refresh process for a well-defined set of busi... | 7\nWeb application used for ordering management lease vehicles.
