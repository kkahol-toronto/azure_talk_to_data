    "Actual Launch Date": "### Column Summary: Actual Launch Date\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe \"Actual Launch Date\" column records the specific date (and time, though always 00:00:00) on which a product, project, or event was actually launched. This is crucial for tracking timelines, measuring delays or early completions against scheduled dates, and performing post-launch analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThe column contains 75 unique dates, each represented as a pandas `Timestamp`. These dates range from March 24, 2024, to March 15, 2025, indicating launches distributed over roughly a year.\n\nSample unique values:\n- 2024-03-24\n- 2024-05-22\n- 2024-07-31\n- 2024-11-30\n- 2025-03-15\n...and more.\n\n*(Full list available in your data above.)*\n\n---\n\n**Histogram (Top values):**\n\n| Launch Date         | Count |\n|---------------------|-------|\n| 2024-12-15          | 47    |\n| 2025-01-31          | 37    |\n| 2025-02-28          | 22    |\n| 2024-12-20          | 11    |\n| 2025-01-15          | 11    |\n| 2024-09-30          | 8     |\n| 2025-02-14          | 7     |\n| 2024-12-23          | 6     |\n| 2025-03-04          | 6     |\n| 2024-11-25          | 6     |\n| ...                 | ...   |\n\n- The distribution is right-skewed, with a few dates having a high concentration of launches (e.g., Dec 15, 2024, and Jan 31, 2025).\n- Most dates have only 1\u20135 launches.\n\n*(Full histogram available in your data above.)*\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis column is essential for understanding when actual launches occurred. Most launches are clustered around a few key dates, while the majority of dates have only a small number of launches. This pattern may reflect internal planning cycles, deadlines, or market-driven timing."
