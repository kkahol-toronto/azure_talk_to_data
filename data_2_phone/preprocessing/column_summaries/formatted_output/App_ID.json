    "name": "App ID",
    "Purpose": "The \"App ID\" column uniquely identifies each application in the dataset. It serves as a primary key, ensuring that each row refers to a distinct application entry. This column is essential for referencing, merging, or filtering data specific to individual applications.",
    "Unique Values": "- Total unique values (example list): [53108, 50417, 18718, 13896, 21453, ...]\n- These represent distinct applications, each with a unique integer identifier.",
    "Histogram": "The histogram below shows how many times each App ID appears in the dataset. Most App IDs are unique or occur infrequently, but some appear multiple times, likely due to multiple records (e.g., updates, region-specific data, or duplicate entries).\n\n| App ID | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| 13017  | 7     |\n| 17826  | 7     |\n| 11760  | 7     |\n| 21526  | 7     |\n| 86     | 6     |\n| 20670  | 6     |\n| 16800  | 6     |\n| 94     | 6     |\n| 9088   | 6     |\n| ...    | ...   |\n| (many App IDs) | 4-7 each |\n\n- Most App IDs occur 4\u20137 times.\n- There are no extremely high-frequency IDs, suggesting the dataset is not heavily skewed toward a few applications.\n- The distribution is relatively flat with respect to repeated App IDs.",
    "Insights": "The \"App ID\" column is a categorical, identifier-type column with a moderate number of repeated values, likely reflecting multiple records per application rather than a single unique entry for each. This is typical for datasets tracking application histories, updates, or region-specific data."
