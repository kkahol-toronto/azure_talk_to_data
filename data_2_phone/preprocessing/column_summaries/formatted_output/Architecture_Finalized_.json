    "name": "Architecture Finalized %",
    "Purpose": "This column represents the percentage completion of the architecture finalization process for a given project or item. It quantifies progress on a scale from 0.0 (not started) to 1.0 (fully finalized), with intermediate values indicating partial completion.\n\n-",
    "Unique Values": "The column contains the following unique values:\n  - 0.0 (not started)\n  - 0.25 (25% finalized)\n  - 0.5 (50% finalized)\n  - 0.75 (75% finalized)\n  - 1.0 (fully finalized)\n\n-",
    "Histogram": "Distribution of values in the column:\n  - 1.0: 263 entries (most common, indicating most items are fully finalized)\n  - 0.75: 29 entries\n  - 0.5: 4 entries\n  - 0.25: 20 entries\n  - 0.0: 5 entries\n\nThis suggests that the majority of projects/items have completed architecture finalization, while fewer are in earlier stages of progress.",
