    "name": "PDO Timing",
    "Purpose": "The \"PDO Timing\" column indicates the planned or expected timing for the Project Development Order (PDO) milestone for each project. This helps stakeholders track when key project decisions or approvals are scheduled or anticipated to occur.",
    "Unique Values": "The column contains the following unique values representing different quarters and years, as well as unspecified (\"TBD\") and a range:\n\n- 'TBD'\n- 'Q3 2027'\n- 'Q4 2027'\n- 'Q3 2025'\n- 'Q4 2025'\n- 'Q2 2025'\n- 'Q1 2027'\n- 'Q1 2026'\n- 'Q4 2024'\n- 'Q4 2026'\n- 'Q1 2025'\n- 'Q3 2026'\n- 'Q2 2026'\n- 'Q2 2027'\n- '2027-2028'\n- 'Q2 2025*'\n- 2024\n- 'Q3 2024'\n- 'Q2 2024'",
    "Histogram": "Shows the frequency of each value in the dataset:\n\n| Value        | Count |\n|--------------|-------|\n| TBD          | 1210  |\n| Q4 2025      | 405   |\n| Q4 2026      | 347   |\n| Q2 2025      | 250   |\n| Q4 2024      | 213   |\n| Q1 2025      | 212   |\n| Q1 2026      | 193   |\n| Q3 2025      | 156   |\n| Q3 2027      | 126   |\n| Q2 2026      | 114   |\n| Q3 2026      | 89    |\n| Q4 2027      | 86    |\n| 2027-2028    | 46    |\n| Q1 2027      | 42    |\n| Q2 2027      | 31    |\n| Q2 2025*     | 1     |\n| 2024         | 1     |\n| Q3 2024      | 1     |\n| Q2 2024      | 1     |",
    "Insights": "The majority of projects (1210) have their PDO timing listed as \"TBD\" (To Be Determined), indicating that the timing has not been finalized for most entries. The next most common values correspond to quarters in 2025 and 2026, suggesting a concentration of expected PDO milestones in those years. There are also a few outliers and specific entries (like 'Q2 2025*', '2027-2028', and standalone years or quarters), which may represent special cases or data entry inconsistencies."
