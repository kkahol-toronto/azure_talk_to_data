    "name": "BMIT",
    "Purpose": "The BMIT column likely indicates whether a specific condition, attribute, or test (possibly related to BMI or another binary classification) applies to each entry. It serves as a binary categorical field to distinguish between \"Yes\" (applicable) and \"No\" (not applicable).\n\n-",
    "Unique Values": "- 'No'\n  - 'Yes'\n  - 'no' (appears to be a case variant of 'No')\n\n-",
    "Histogram": "- 'No': 3386 entries\n  - 'Yes': 334 entries\n  - 'no': 1 entry\n\n**Notes:**  \n- The presence of both 'No' and 'no' suggests minor data inconsistency, which may benefit from standardization.  \n- The column is heavily skewed towards 'No', indicating the condition or attribute is rare in the dataset.",
