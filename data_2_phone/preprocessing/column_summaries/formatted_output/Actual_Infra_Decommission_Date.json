    "name": "Actual Infra. Decommission Date",
    "Purpose": "The \"Actual Infra. Decommission Date\" column records the specific dates when pieces of infrastructure were actually decommissioned (taken out of service). This is a critical field for tracking project progress, compliance, and resource management, ensuring that infrastructure retirement aligns with operational and strategic plans.\n\n---",
    "Unique Values": "There are 61 unique decommission dates in the column, ranging from March 24, 2024, to March 15, 2025. Each value represents a distinct date on which one or more infrastructure components were decommissioned.\n\nExample unique values:\n- 2024-03-24\n- 2024-06-29\n- 2024-07-07\n- 2024-08-05\n- 2024-09-17\n- ...\n- 2025-03-15\n\n---",
    "Histogram": "",
    "Insights": "- The column is used for tracking actual, not planned, decommission events.\n- There are a few peak dates suggesting coordinated infrastructure shutdowns or project phases.\n- The spread of unique dates allows for analysis of decommission patterns over time."
