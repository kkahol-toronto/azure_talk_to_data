    "App Acronym": "Summary of the \"App Acronym\" Column\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe \"App Acronym\" column identifies the application associated with each record using a short, unique code or acronym. This enables users to quickly reference and group records by their corresponding applications, supporting efficient data analysis, filtering, and reporting.\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThe column contains a wide range of unique acronyms representing different applications. Here are some examples:\n- ZAS\n- Estimator\n- XUI\n- XNet\n- vehdyn\n- XCC\n- WOW\n- WF1\n- WPX\n- WMA  \n...and many more (a total of 100+ unique values as provided).\n\n**Histogram (Frequency of Occurrence):**  \nThe histogram shows how many times each acronym appears. Here are highlights from the data:\n- The most common values (appearing 7 times each): MFV, REMAN, EDB, GOaLS\n- Values appearing 6 times: SMARTS, VMACS (EU), GOLDD, MPS2, GCQIS, SOR, SOFRELS, ESPS, SIM\n- Values appearing 5 times: MEVIS, SAWS, FST-Report, OWS Claims, MX09FNCC, TER, WBDO 2.0, ISIS, VSO, FOMPINV, FSR, APS -AuthZ, GLAS, GEM, SERVIS2, VIDS, GOTD - GOB, ESBOL, GWFS, GEMSS, GCMS, GT&T, DOESII, CVOS, DEFT, ESPARS, VDLS, IDSFDBCK, GIVIS, PartnerIAM, VISTA, AMROClaims, GOTD - OIS, RTOM, eAPQP, PS&L GSPPS, SBOM, RIP/SOS, Phoenix, NextGen, GIROBS, SCA-C, AREI, RSWHYP\n- Values appearing 4 times: LOS, PIFA, BPM, CSS, FMMS, DRIVE, ARVE, HVBOM, Stamps, CusLoylRet, EOH, SV2, FCOTLS, Infa-MDM, IMS-IA, ECOMMIT, CDV, UVIS, STARS106, eBCM, Agenda, NFe, FPSMS, GOTD-TDI, KDLOTSOM, PC: M11317, SIN, BP, GPW, CPARS, ISMD, ePay, NGGPP, GSLTS, payonline, SOE, CRIS 2.0, STARS RPTS, SLA, PANDA, PDO, DID, PEDDS\n\n**Histogram Example (Top Entries):**\n| App Acronym     | Count |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| MFV             | 7     |\n| REMAN           | 7     |\n| EDB             | 7     |\n| GOaLS           | 7     |\n| SMARTS          | 6     |\n| ...             | ...   |\n| MEVIS           | 5     |\n| SAWS            | 5     |\n| ...             | ...   |\n| LOS             | 4     |\n| PIFA            | 4     |\n| ...             | ...   |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe \"App Acronym\" column serves to uniquely identify the application for each record. Its values are application-specific codes, with some being much more frequent than others, as illustrated by the histogram. This column is valuable for categorizing and analyzing data by application."
