    "Count": "Summary of the \"Count\" Column\n\nPurpose:\nThe \"Count\" column likely represents the number of occurrences, items, or instances related to each record in the dataset. It is a discrete numerical variable indicating how many times something is counted for each entry.\n\nUnique Values:\nThe column contains the following unique values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nHistogram:\n\n- 1: 634 occurrences\n- 2: 1192 occurrences\n- 3: 975 occurrences\n- 4: 630 occurrences\n- 5: 213 occurrences\n- 6: 49 occurrences\n- 7: 28 occurrences\n\nThe histogram shows that the most common value is 2, followed by 3, with higher counts (5, 6, 7) being much less frequent. This suggests that most records have a \"Count\" of 2 or 3."
