    "Actual Infra. Decommission Date": "**Column Summary: Actual Infra. Decommission Date**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe \"Actual Infra. Decommission Date\" column records the specific dates when pieces of infrastructure were actually decommissioned (taken out of service). This is a critical field for tracking project progress, compliance, and resource management, ensuring that infrastructure retirement aligns with operational and strategic plans.\n\n---\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are 61 unique decommission dates in the column, ranging from March 24, 2024, to March 15, 2025. Each value represents a distinct date on which one or more infrastructure components were decommissioned.\n\nExample unique values:\n- 2024-03-24\n- 2024-06-29\n- 2024-07-07\n- 2024-08-05\n- 2024-09-17\n- ...\n- 2025-03-15\n\n---\n\n**Histogram (Frequency of Each Date):**\n\nThe most common decommission dates and their respective counts are:\n\n| Date           | Count |\n|----------------|-------|\n| 2025-01-31     | 39    |\n| 2024-12-15     | 33    |\n| 2025-02-28     | 26    |\n| 2024-12-23     | 12    |\n| 2025-01-15     | 11    |\n| 2025-01-06     | 9     |\n| 2025-01-20     | 8     |\n| 2024-11-25     | 7     |\n| ...            | ...   |\n| (other dates)  | \u22646    |\n\n- The majority of decommissions are clustered on a few key dates (notably Jan 31, 2025, Dec 15, 2024, and Feb 28, 2025).\n- Many other dates have only a handful (1\u20135) of decommissions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Histogram (Top 5 Dates):**\n\n| Date           | Count |\n|----------------|-------|\n| 2025-01-31     | 39    |\n| 2024-12-15     | 33    |\n| 2025-02-28     | 26    |\n| 2024-12-23     | 12    |\n| 2025-01-15     | 11    |\n\n---\n\n**Insights:**\n- The column is used for tracking actual, not planned, decommission events.\n- There are a few peak dates suggesting coordinated infrastructure shutdowns or project phases.\n- The spread of unique dates allows for analysis of decommission patterns over time."
