    "Planned Launch Date": "**Column Summary: Planned Launch Date**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe \"Planned Launch Date\" column records the scheduled date for a planned launch event. It is used to track and organize when each launch is expected to occur, supporting project management, scheduling, and progress tracking.\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are 81 unique dates (Timestamps) in this column, each representing a specific planned launch date.\n\nSome example unique values include:\n- 2024-03-24\n- 2024-12-15\n- 2025-03-15\n- 2025-12-15\n- 2026-12-15\n- 2027-09-15\n(see the full list above for all dates)\n\n**Histogram (Top Frequencies):**\n\n| Planned Launch Date    | Count |\n|----------------------- |-------|\n| 2025-12-15             | 352   |\n| 2026-12-15             | 293   |\n| 2026-03-15             | 186   |\n| 2025-06-15             | 137   |\n| 2024-12-15             | 131   |\n| 2025-09-15             | 121   |\n| 2025-03-15             | 120   |\n| 2026-06-15             | 106   |\n| 2026-09-15             | 89    |\n| 2027-09-15             | 82    |\n| 2027-12-15             | 66    |\n| (others, each \u2264 42)    | ...   |\n\nThere is a long tail of dates with fewer planned launches, some with only 1 occurrence.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe \"Planned Launch Date\" column is crucial for scheduling and tracking planned launches. Most launches are clustered around a few key dates (e.g., mid-December and mid-June across several years), likely reflecting major launch cycles or milestones, while many other dates have only a handful or a single planned launch. This distribution suggests both regular launch windows and occasional outliers."
