    "Modernization Strategy": "**Column Summary: Modernization Strategy**\n\n**Purpose:**\nThe \"Modernization Strategy\" column captures the planned or completed approach for updating, migrating, or decommissioning IT systems and applications. It helps track the modernization status and direction for each asset, such as migration to cloud platforms, version upgrades, rewriting applications, or decommissioning.\n\n**Unique Values:**\nThere are 31 unique values in this column, representing a variety of modernization strategies, including:\n- Migration to cloud platforms (e.g., GCP, SaaS, CP4D)\n- Rewriting or upgrading applications\n- Decommissioning or already decommissioned assets\n- Optimization efforts (e.g., MIPs reduction)\n- Specific technology migrations (e.g., to QlikSense, Power BI, SAP4/Hana)\n- Some blank or ambiguous entries (e.g., ' ', 0)\n\n**Unique Values List:**\n- 'EDC New Hypervisor'\n- 'Complete Migration to GCP (Both App & DB)'\n- ' '\n- 'Version Upgrade'\n- 'Will be Decommissioned'\n- 'Modernize to Cloud Databases'\n- 'Partial Migration to GCP'\n- 'Complete Migration to SaaS '\n- 'Rewrite'\n- 'Rewrite apps to GCP'\n- 'Migrate to QlikSense'\n- 'Optimize MF - MIPs reduction'\n- 'On-Prem'\n- 'EDC CaaS'\n- 'Migrate to Webfocus 9'\n- 0\n- 'Modernize'\n- 'Migrate/Rewrite ONLY heavy batch/reporting jobs to GCP'\n- 'Move Capabilities to SaaS Solution'\n- 'EDC CaaS and New EDC Hypervisor'\n- 'Already Decommissioned'\n- 'Migrate to CP4D'\n- 'Partial Migration to SaaS'\n- 'Migrate to Power BI'\n- 'Complete Migration to SaaS'\n- '\\xa0Will be Decomissioned'\n- 'Decommission'\n- 'Move to Pega'\n- 'Migrate to QlikSense + Big Query'\n- 'Already decommissioned(Q4 2024)'\n- 'No Datastage'\n- 'Migrate to SAP4/Hana'\n\n**Histogram (Top 10 Most Common Strategies):**\n| Strategy                                       | Count |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Will be Decommissioned                         | 886   |\n| Modernize to Cloud Databases                   | 441   |\n| Complete Migration to GCP (Both App & DB)      | 363   |\n| Rewrite                                        | 361   |\n| Version Upgrade                                | 276   |\n| EDC New Hypervisor                             | 267   |\n| On-Prem                                        | 221   |\n| 0                                              | 95    |\n| Complete Migration to SaaS                     | 78    |\n| Optimize MF - MIPs reduction                   | 76    |\n\n*Other strategies, including partial migrations, rewrites, upgrades to specific platforms, and blank/ambiguous entries, have lower frequencies (ranging from 50 down to 1 occurrence).*\n\n**Notes:**\n- The column contains some ambiguous or potentially erroneous values such as blank strings (' '), zeros (0), and entries with minor formatting differences (e.g., extra spaces, non-standard characters).\n- The most common strategy is \u201cWill be Decommissioned,\u201d indicating a significant number of assets are planned for retirement.\n- Migration and modernization to cloud platforms are also prominent strategies in the dataset."
