    "LL5 (Org)": "### Column Summary: LL5 (Org)\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe `LL5 (Org)` column likely represents the identifier or username of an individual (such as an employee, user, or owner) associated with a specific record or transaction in the dataset. This field is often used to attribute actions, entries, or responsibilities to specific persons within an organization.\n\n---\n\n**Unique Values:**  \nThere are **over 100 unique values** in this column, each corresponding to a distinct user or identifier. Examples include:  \n- DCLEME13\n- CBOHN\n- SGATTI\n- SLINDSTR\n- TBROWN99  \n...and many more.\n\n---\n\n**Value Distribution (Histogram):**  \nThe histogram below shows the frequency (count) of the top unique values in the column:\n\n| Value      | Count |\n|------------|-------|\n| RCORDEI1   | 130   |\n| DWIERZBI   | 82    |\n| BGANESH    | 73    |\n| RRAJESH8   | 68    |\n| JEISIMIN   | 66    |\n| DBRIGHEN   | 65    |\n| GDIAZ1     | 64    |\n| LSRINIVA   | 63    |\n| VDONTHY    | 63    |\n| JCHAUSSE   | 53    |\n| ...        | ...   |\n\n- The most frequent value is **RCORDEI1** (130 occurrences).\n- Many values occur only a handful of times (e.g., some appear less than 10 times).\n\n**Histogram Shape (Summary):**\n- The distribution is **right-skewed**: a few users have a high count, but most have low counts.\n- This suggests that a small number of individuals are responsible for a large share of the records.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- **Purpose:** Identifies the user/owner for each record.\n- **Unique Values:** 100+ (examples given above).\n- **Histogram:** Highly skewed, with a few users dominating the count.\n\nIf you need a graphical histogram or more detailed statistics (e.g., exact number of unique users, mean, median), please let me know!"
